# TheeBugger$
The bug tracking website is designed to streamline the process of identifying, reporting, and resolving bugs within software projects. It supports three user roles: **Manager**, **Tester**, and **Developer**, each with specific permissions and responsibilities. The platform employs a robust **token-based authentication and authorization system** to ensure secure access to features and data. Built with a **layered architecture**, the backend is developed in **Java**, ensuring scalability and maintainability, while the frontend is crafted with **HTML** and **CSS** for a responsive and user-friendly interface. This setup allows for efficient management of bugs and facilitates smooth collaboration among team members.
